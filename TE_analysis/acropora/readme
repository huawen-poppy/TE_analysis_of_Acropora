first we need to 
(1) de novo identify the TE for the acropora using the longrepmasker (https://github.com/BioinformaticsCSU/LongRepMarker)

(2) used the predicted sequence as input to the repeatmasker to do the annotation (https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatMasker)

(3) run kallisto to map the sc-seq data into TE reference 

(4) downstream analysis of the TE expression
